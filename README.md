#This is a Regression Technique using PySpark

I Predicted House Price using PySpark Library. Because PySpark is very easy to handle a big dataset when we have Million Million rows and thousands thousnads columns.I made some auto functions to work/handle the dataset easily for example comparing columns for train and test dataset, Handling null value, finding categorical and Numerical variable. 



##The Major Work of this Project are

1. I trained with different different algorithms
2. I tuned with Hyperparametered tuning.
